Creating a web-based eco-friendly e-commerce platform is a great project idea. I can provide you with a high-level overview of the steps you need to take and suggest resources that can help you complete this project. Note that since I can't provide direct links to current external resources, I'll guide you on how to find them.

**1. Front-end Development:**
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Start by learning these fundamental web technologies. You can find numerous tutorials and courses on websites like MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and freeCodeCamp.
   - Responsive Design: Learn about responsive design to ensure your website looks good on various devices. CSS Grid and Flexbox are essential for this.
   - Eco-Friendly Design: Research eco-friendly design principles and consider using sustainable design practices, like optimizing images and reducing HTTP requests.
   
**2. Back-end Development:**
   - MongoDB: Learn how to set up and use MongoDB for your database. MongoDB's official documentation is a great resource.
   - Node.js: Consider using Node.js for your back-end, as it pairs well with MongoDB. You can find tutorials on the Node.js website.
   - Express.js: Explore Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js. Express.js documentation and tutorials are available online.

**3. User Registration and Profiles:**
   - Create user registration and login systems. There are many tutorials and videos on user authentication with Node.js and MongoDB.

**4. Product Listings:**
   - Create a database schema for products and implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage products.

**5. Search and Filter:**
   - Implement search and filter functionality using JavaScript and MongoDB queries.

**6. Shopping Cart:**
   - Build a shopping cart feature that allows users to add and manage products in their cart. You can use JavaScript for this.

**7. User Reviews and Ratings:**
   - Develop a system for users to leave reviews and ratings for products. Consider implementing a star rating system.

**8. Admin Panel:**
   - Design and implement an admin panel using Node.js and MongoDB to manage product listings and user accounts.

**9. Security:**
   - Learn about security best practices, including data encryption, input validation, and secure authentication. Resources like OWASP can help.

**10. Environmental Impact Information:**
   - Research and gather environmental information about each product. You may need to use APIs or manually input this data into your database.

**11. Blog/News Section:**
   - Create a blog or news section for sustainability-related content. Use a CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress if you prefer an easier solution.

**12. Deployment:**
   - Host your website on a web hosting platform or a cloud service like Heroku or AWS. You may need to buy a domain name and configure DNS settings.

**Additional Tasks:**
   - Video Creation: After completing the project, create a video showcasing your work, including a demo of the website's features.
   - LinkedIn Posting: Share the video on LinkedIn with appropriate hashtags to showcase your skills and build credibility.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one. Consult online tutorials, documentation, and forums when you encounter challenges. Good luck with your eco-friendly e-commerce platform project!
